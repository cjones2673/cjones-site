    <h1><u>Academic Projects</u></h1>
    <h2> As of July 2024, the most noteworthy project I've worked on was a task management webapp I created along side several other teammates for my CS 230 Web Development class at WVU. </h2> 

    <p>The app is called "Task Garden." In the app, the user is able to create and manage a list of tasks, and with each task complete, they can earn points to upgrade a virtual plant, granting them a sense of progress. It's a very rudimentary project, with it being my first and all, however I think it turned out alright. Click the screenshot below to try the app for yourself.</p>

    <p>The frontend of the app was implemented using ReactJS and the backend using Google Firestore. The app is also hosted with the help of Google Firebase, making use of their Firebase Hosting Service. The app was created in Spring of 2024, over the course of a few months, thanks to the help of my CS 230 teammates. The repository for this project can be accessed <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WVU-CS230-2024-01-Group10/TaskGarden?tab=readme-ov-file">here</a>.</p>
